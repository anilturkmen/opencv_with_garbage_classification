# Waste Classification System

# This project enables automatic classification of recyclable wastes (glass, metal, paper, plastic, cardboard, and tetra pak) using computer vision systems.

## Technologies Used

 - Python
 - OpenCV
 - NumPy
 - Keras

## Requirements

# To run this project, you need Python installed on your computer. Additionally, you will need the following Python libraries:

# ```
 pip install opencv-python numpy keras
# ```

## Usage

 1. Place the model file named `model_yuzde91.keras` in the project's main directory.
 2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt to run the code.
 3. Start the program by running the following command:

# ```
# python garbage_classification.py
# ```

 4. Your camera will open, and the system will be ready to classify wastes. Show the waste to the camera, and you will see the predicted type of waste on the screen.
 5. Press 'q' on your keyboard to exit.
